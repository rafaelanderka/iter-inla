try generating sample from stochastic heat equation
try model mismatch
du/dt = kappa * laplace u
remove data from initial condition (only keep some or consider none)

29.03
run over more random seeds
try forcing initial condition step

instead of mat.T @ mat can we use just mat to do the computations?
can we avoid posterior_precision inversion? can we avoid instantiating dense matrix?
what we want is marginal uncertainty
-> revisit lindgren
-> sparse linear algebra tricks to approximate diagonal of inv covariance?
computation of posterior mean should scale in the number of data points instead of test points
find library compatible with both backpropagation and sparse matrices (and the two together)
